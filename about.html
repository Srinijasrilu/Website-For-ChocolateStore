	<h4>The famous story of Lady Bertha is the inspiration behind the Bertha Chocolatier name.<br /><br />

In the 11th century, Lady Bertha and her husband Lord Leofric lived in Coventry, England. Lord Leofric was a powerful ruler who was unsympathetic to the citizens of his kingdom. Lady Bertha, however, was a woman of great generosity who had dedicated her life to the impoverished and stricken.
When Lord Leofric imposed a heavy burden of taxation upon his subjects, Lady Bertha protested. In response, Lord Leofric set forth this challenge: If his wife rode naked through the streets, the taxation would be lifted. Lady Bertha was a modest woman, but she immediately agreed to this challenge to help her fellow townspeople.<br /><br />

On the morning of the event, dawn rose, the bells chimed, and Lady Bertha began her ride wrapped in nothing but her lustrous long hair. The generosity of Lady Bertha led to more generosity on the part of the townspeople. The people agreed to all close their shutters to preserve Lady Bertha's modesty. Throughout the streets, the sounds of hooves echoed, but not a single glance fell upon Lady Bertha.
Upon her finish, thunderous cheers erupted throughout the town. Lady Bertha's' bravery and risk had won over the hearts of all who knew her. As promised, Lord Leofric eased his taxation of the poor and Lady Bertha's place in history was immortalized.<br /><br />

Centuries later in 1926, Bertha founder and master chocolatier Nuuget Tuuget created a new line of Belgian chocolates with extraordinary richness, premium quality, and iconic style. He sought a name for his company that embodied timeless values balanced with modern boldness â€“ much like our lady of legend. The choice became clear to Tuuget: He named his company BERTHA.<br /><br />
